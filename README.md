# Aviation Accident Risk Dashboard

A data-driven analysis of historical aviation accidents (1962â€“2023), aimed at helping stakeholders identify low-risk aircraft makes and models for acquisition.

---

## Overview

This project explores trends in aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board to support strategic decision-making for a company entering the aviation industry.

The outcome is an interactive dashboard, data analysis, and final business recommendations to guide safe aircraft procurement.

---

## Business Understanding

**Stakeholder:**  
A new aviation division within a larger company evaluating which aircraft to acquire.

**Key Business Questions:**
- Which aircraft makes and models have the highest accident severity?
- How does weather or phase of flight influence accident risk?
- What aircraft should be considered low-risk for acquisition?

##  Data Understanding and Analysis

### ðŸ“¦ Data Source:
- National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Aviation Accident Database  
- (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses)

### Data Summary:
- 40,000+ records from 1962â€“2023
- Features: Aircraft make/model, location, date, injury severity, weather, phase of flight

###  Visualizations:
#### 1. **Bar Chart:** Top 15 Aircraft Models by Risk Level  
Shows severity distribution per model using color-coded risk levels.

#### 2. **Heatmap:** Aircraft Make vs. Weather Condition  
Highlights accident trends by manufacturer under VMC/IMC conditions.

#### 3. **Line Chart:** Accidents Over Time  
Tracks year-by-year trends and highlights spikes/declines.

## Conclusion

### Key Findings:
- **Cessna 172** and **Beech A36** are high-risk models with a large number of fatal incidents.
- **Piper PA-28** shows moderate frequency but better survivability.
- Weather (IMC) and flight phase (landing/takeoff) are critical risk multipliers.

### Final Recommendations:
To safely enter the aviation space:

1. **Avoid Cessna aircraft** in your entry fleet â€” especially 172 â€” due to their disproportionate fatal involvement.
2. **Select Piper PA-28** for general aviation; it's more survivable and broadly operated under VMC.
3. For commercial aspirations, **Boeing models show excellent safety** profiles and are well-regulated.
4. **Build robust training and weather policy frameworks** â€” especially for models with higher risk during takeoff/landing.
